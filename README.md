# Encoder-Decoder
Welcome to Encoder-Decoder! a Python program designed to encode and decode messages. This program uses a combination of random letters and character rearrangement to encrypt your message. Use it to secure your messages and keep them private. Developed by Moazzam, this program is easy to use and open-source. Enjoy!
Encoder/Decoder
This is a Python application that can be used to encode or decode messages using a simple encryption algorithm. The application uses a random set of letters to encode the message and also provides a decoding feature to retrieve the original message.
